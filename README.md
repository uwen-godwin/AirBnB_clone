# AirBnB Clone

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

## Description

The AirBnB clone project aims to build a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB-like objects. This project serves as the first step towards building a full web application, providing the foundation for HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Command Interpreter

### Description

The command interpreter is a crucial component of the AirBnB clone project. It allows users to manage objects by performing operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting instances of various classes.

### Execution

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./console.py

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
